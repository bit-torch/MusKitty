# MusKitty

From-scratch browser core modules in safe Rust. Independent implementations of
WHATWG and CSSWG specifications — not a Chromium fork, not a binding around an
existing engine. Each module is published as an independent crate on crates.io
and developed in its own git repository under the
[`muskitty-dev`](https://github.com/muskitty-dev) organization. This repository
is the workspace coordinator and project-level documentation hub.

Test status (latest CI): each independent repo runs 6 jobs (Check / Unit
Tests / Integration Tests / Format / Clippy / MSRV 1.82). See PROGRESS.md for
the per-crate test matrix.

### What is intentionally out of scope

- Rendering / compositing / GPU integration
- JavaScript engine (no V8, no Blink)
- Browser UI / Chrome / extensions
- Networking beyond top-level document GET (the network layer covers plain
  `http(s)` document fetches today; CORS / cookies / cache and full WHATWG
  Fetch semantics are future work)

The project has completed Phase 2 (CSS parsing layer: tokenizer, parser,
selectors, values, CSSOM, and cascade), Phase 3 (Layout: taffy 0.12
integration with CSS Cascade + DOM), and Phase 4 (Renderer: DOM → CSS →
Layout → Render to PNG/window, including text rendering via cosmic-text).
Recent work added position/overflow/grid layout support and decoupled
external dependencies (taffy / tiny-skia / cosmic-text / reqwest) from the
public APIs of their crates. Layer 5 (Network) provides a `NetworkFetcher`
trait abstraction + reqwest backend and is wired to the browser shell: the
chrome window's address bar navigates `http(s)` and `file` URLs through
muskitty-network (top-level document GET) — see [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)
for the layer roadmap and the native HTTP stack plan.

📦 = workspace member, tracked in this repo.
🔗 = extracted as independent repo (gitignored here); use `fetch-crates.ps1` to pull.

The 3 workspace members (`muskitty-renderer`, `muskitty-network`,
`muskitty-chrome`) depend on the extracted crates via `path = "..."`. The
extracted crates are listed in `Cargo.toml → exclude` (not `members`) and are
each their own `[workspace]` root.

## Using the published crates

Each crate can be consumed independently. The common case is to depend on a
facade crate (e.g. `muskitty-css`, `muskitty-selectors`) and let it pull in
the lower-level pieces.

```toml
[dependencies]
muskitty-css = "0.4"
muskitty-selectors = "0.1"
muskitty-html5-parser = "0.1"
muskitty-dom = "0.1"
```

MSRV: Rust 1.82+ across all crates.

## Building locally

The workspace members (`muskitty-renderer`, `muskitty-network`,
`muskitty-chrome`) depend on crates that are **not** tracked in this repo
because each has been extracted to its own repository under
[`muskitty-dev`](https://github.com/muskitty-dev). A fresh clone will be
missing those directories — run the fetch script first.

### One-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ink-dark/MusKitty.git
cd MusKitty

# Pull all standalone dependency crates into crates/ (list = crates.json)
pwsh ./fetch-crates.ps1 clone    # Windows
# or
./fetch-crates.sh clone           # macOS / Linux
```

`crates.json` is the single source of truth for which crates are standalone
(fetched from `muskitty-dev`) and which are bundled workspace members; both
scripts read it and cross-check it against `crates/`, `Cargo.toml` members,
and the remote org at the end of every run.

### Day-to-day

```bash
# Update all standalone crates to latest
pwsh ./fetch-crates.ps1           # pull mode (default)

# Workspace-wide checks
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Each standalone crate can also be built individually inside `crates/<name>/`.

## Engineering conventions

- **Ground truth**: WHATWG / CSSWG specs. WPT and html5lib test suites are
  consumed as conformance checks, but if a test diverges from the current
  spec, the spec wins.
- **Safety**: stable Rust, zero `unsafe` outside FFI boundaries (none
  currently), zero C/C++ dependencies.
- **Coverage**: each module ships its own unit + integration tests; public
  APIs have doc comments citing the spec section.
- **History**: linear, rebase-only. Each sub-task is one commit formatted as
  `[module] what + why` (e.g. `[tokenizer] add Data state, §13.2.5.1`).
- **Extraction**: a crate is split into its own git repo once it reaches spec
  coverage parity with the next layer's entry threshold, then published to
  crates.io via a tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full hard-constraint list and
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for detailed progress per layer.

## About the name

**MusCat** (口罩猫, "mask cat") is the eventual browser product.
**MusKitty** is its in-development core: the smart kitten inside the mask,
listening for instructions. The project is unrelated to any other cat-themed
project or brand.
